        <h3>THE TRAFFFIC RULES</h3>
        <h6><em>Why should we follow them?</em></h6><br>
        <p>The importance of traffic signs and road rules cannot be ignored in one’s life and it
             should be given paramount importance. Any driver who is driving a vehicle on the road
              should be aware of all the traffic signs and rules. The government has already made it
               mandatory for any person who wishes to obtain a driving licence in India for the different traffic signs and
                rules.</p>

        <h2><strong>Basic Traffic Rules and Manners:</strong></h2><br>
            <p>The number of vehicles in India has been on the rise and, along with it, the traffic on the road has 
increased substantially. It’s important that you are aware of the basic traffic rules and manners to 
ensure you follow them for your safety as well as for other road users. To enjoy the smooth operation of
 the traffic, it’s recommended that you carefully observe all rules and regulations set by the traffic department.</p><br>
<br>
<p><strong> Here are some of the essential road safety rules in India:</strong></p>
<br>
<h4 ><strong>1)Keep Left:</strong></h4>
        <p> While driving/riding on a two-way road, ensure you drive your vehicle 
            on the left side of the road and let the oncoming traffic to pass on the right side.</p>
        <br><h4><strong>2)Use Indicators: </strong></h4>
        <p>You should use the prescribed hand signs or indicators to signal to other road users
             that you’re taking a turn, or slowing down, or overtaking, or stopping.
                <br> </p>
        <br><h4><strong>3) Wear Helmet: </strong></h5>
        <p>Always a helmet while riding a two-wheeler, and ensure your pillion wears a helmet too.
         Make sure the helmet is ISI certified as any deviation will lead to penalties for traffic violations.</p>

         <br><h4><strong>4) Wear Seatbelt: :</strong></h4>
        <p> For four-wheeler users, it’s essential to wear the seatbelt, 
            this holds good for both the driver, the co-driver and other passengers. Not wearing seatbelts will attract a hefty penalty.</p>
        
       <br><h4><strong>5) Do Not Use Mobile Phone:</strong></h4>
        <p> Using a mobile phone while driving or riding might lead to an accident.
             It’s mandatory not to use phones while driving or riding. </p>
        
        <br><h4><strong>6) Display Registration Marks Clearly: </strong></h4>
        <p>You must ensure that all vehicle registration marks are displayed clearly and not hidden.</p>
      
          <br><h4><strong>7)Overtake only from the Right Side:</strong></h4>
        <p> While overtaking another vehicle moving in the same direction, 
            ensure you do so from the right side of that vehicle only. Also,
             indicate by dipping and dimming your headlights which will alert the vehicle in front of you. 
             Overtaking is prohibited while turning or in a curve as you may not have a clear view of the road ahead. </p>
        
        <br><h4><strong>8) Give Way to Emergency Vehicles:</strong></h4>
        <p>It’s your responsibility to give free passage to ambulances and fire service vehicles.</p>

        <br><h4><strong>9) Maintain Lane Discipline:</strong></h4>
        <p>Changing lanes frequently could lead to an accident. Ensure you follow lane discipline at all times. 
            If you’re looking to turn left, then drive on the left-most lane of the road so that you do not 
            inconvenience to other road users.</p>
        <br><h4><strong>10) Maintain Prescribed Speed Limit: </strong></h4>
        <p>Follow the prescribed speed limit at both city limits and on highways. 
            Overspeeding attracts a hefty fine and could be dangerous for other road users.</p>
        <br><h4><strong>11) Follow Road Signs:</strong></h4>
        <p> Road signs such as ‘No Parking’, ‘No Right Turn or Left Turn’, 
            ‘No Honking’, etc. should be followed effectively for your safety and others.</p>
        <br><h4><strong>12)‘U’ Turn:</strong></h4>
        <p> You can take a ‘U’ Turn only when there’s no warning sign, and when there’s no traffic around your vehicle.
             Also, take it only when it’s safe and give a clear indication to other vehicle users that you’re taking a 
             ‘U’ Turn either through indicators or hand signals.</p>
        <br><h4><strong>13)Maintain Distance Between Vehicles:</strong></h4>
        <p> Traveling close to a vehicle has a good chance that you might crash into the other vehicle if it stops
             abruptly. It’s important to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you so that you have
              enough time to react during emergencies.</p>
        <br><h4><strong>14) Give Way to Pedestrians:</strong></h4>
        <p>Pedestrians have the right to way especially at zebra and pedestrian crossings.</p>
        <br><h4><strong>15)Carry Driving and Vehicle Documents:</strong></h4>
        <p>Always carry vehicle and driving-related documents such as your driving license, vehicle registration 
            certificate, vehicle insurance and emission or PUC (Pollution Under Control) certificate.
             You can carry your DL and RC in digital format through DigiLocker and mParivahan mobile applications.</p>
        <br><h4><strong>16) Don’t Jump a Red Signal: </strong></h4>
        <p>Red light signal is for you to stop on the marked line and not beyond that. You could block vehicles 
            coming from other directions.</p>
        <br><h4><strong>17) Don’t Ride on Footpath:</strong></h4>
        <p> Ensure you ride or drive only on roads and not on the footpath which is exclusive to pedestrians.</p>
        <br><h4><strong>18) Prohibition of Drink and Drive:</strong></h4>
        <p> Driving under the influence of alcohol or other intoxicating substance is prohibited. This can alter your 
            decision-making process while negotiating an accident or following traffic rules.</p>
        <br><h4><strong>19)Unnecessary Honking:</strong></h4>
        <p>Honking is prohibited in and around areas such as schools and hospitals. Also, it’s important not 
            to use your vehicle’s horn unnecessarily as this leads to noise pollution.</p>
        <br><h4><strong>20) Give Way When Another Vehicle Overtakes: </strong></h4>
        <p>When another vehicle is overtaking your vehicle, do not increase speed or do anything that
             hampers the other vehicle from overtaking your vehicle..</p>
        <br><h4><strong>21)Be Careful at Intersections:</strong></h4>
        <p>While approaching an intersection/junction/crossing, ensure that your vehicle is not obstructing the way for other users. 
            Always give way to vehicles which are already moving to that particular road and then proceed once it’s absolutely free.</p>
        <br><h4><strong>22) Do Not Overload: </strong></h4>
        <p>It’s dangerous to overload your vehicle beyond the prescribed loading. Two-wheeler users should 
            carry a pillion rider only and not more than two persons.</p>
