        <h2>Updated List of Rules for Traffic Violations in India – 2019</h2>
        <h4><em>Why should we follow them?</em></h4><br>
        <p>Breaking the law in any sense is bound to attract punishment.
                The severity of this punishment depends upon the nature of the committed offence. 
               With regards to breaking traffic rules, citizens can be asked to pay a fine, serve a jail term or 
               face disqualification in the form of a ban from driving any vehicle.<br>  
               The fine amount is updated every few years to curb the violation of rules. Breaking traffic rules
                in India can lead to accidents and even death in severe cases. Let’s take a look at the updated
                 list of penalties for traffic violations in India.</p>

        <h2><strong>List of Traffic Police Fines for Violations (Updated):</strong></h2><br>
        <p>Traffic rules in India are in accordance with The New Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019. Change in the 
                traffic police fine amount is clearly mentioned in the updated act. 
                New traffic rules are stringent with a steep increase in penalties as well as jail terms or 
                imprisonment for traffic violations.</p><br>
                <h4><strong>Example for Driving without Insurance:</strong></h4>
                <p>If you’re caught driving without insurance, the existing penalty of Rs.1,000 and/or imprisonment of up 
                to 3 months has been increased to Rs.2,000 and/or imprisonment of up to 3 months for the first-time offence 
                and Rs.4,000 and/or imprisonment of up to 3 months for the second-time offence </p>

         first-time offence and Rs.4,000 and/or imprisonment of up to 3 months for the second-time offence.<br> </p>
         
         <br><h4><strong>3) Driving Regardless of Disqualification:</strong></h5>
         <p> The penalty for driving despite disqualification has been hiked from Rs.500 to Rs.10,000

         <br><h4><strong>4) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol or Intoxicating Substance:</strong></h4>
         <p> If you’re caught for drink and drive, get ready to pay a hefty fine of Rs.10,000 and/or 
         imprisonment of up to 6 months for the first-time offence and if you’re caught for the 
         second-time for the same offence, the fine is Rs.15,000 and/or imprisonment of up to 2 years. </p>

        <h3><strong>Bribing Traffic Officials:</strong></h3>
        <br>
        <p>To get away from the fine and penalties arising due to breaking traffic rules in India, 
        people try to bribe police officials. To some extent, people even manage to get away by paying a bribe 
        in the form of cash. However, bribing an official is a crime in itself and should not be committed. 
        The government is taking certain measures to decrease and eventually eliminate this atrocious crime.
         One of such measures is the introduction of ‘e-challan‘. This system works similar to you purchasing 
         something and using your debit or credit card to pay the money and receiving a receipt. This way, cash 
         does not come into the picture and the funds are transferred directly to the government. In this manner, 
         they can also keep a track of offences and the people involved.</p>
